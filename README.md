# 🔐 Password Generator App by Akash Halder

A simple yet powerful Password Generator app built with React Native! This project was created as part of my learning journey in React Native, where I explored key functionalities, including generating secure passwords and implementing routing with Expo Router.

## 📱 Features

- **Password Length Customization**: Choose your desired password length.
- **Character Options**: Toggle options for uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
- **Expo Router Integration**: Easy navigation within the app for a seamless user experience.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React Native**: For building the mobile app interface.
- **Expo Router**: For streamlined routing and navigation.
- **JavaScript**: Core language for logic and functionality.
